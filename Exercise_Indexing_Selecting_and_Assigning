# In this set of exercises we will work with the Wine Reviews dataset.
# Run the following cell to load your data and some utility functions (including code to check your answers).
reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", 5)

# Look at an overview of your data by running the following line.
reviews.head()


# Select the description column from reviews and assign the result to the variable desc.
# Your code here
desc = reviews.description


# Select the first value from the description column of reviews, assigning it to variable first_description.
first_description = reviews.loc[0, 'description']


# Select the first row of data (the first record) from reviews, assigning it to the variable first_row.
first_row = reviews.iloc[0]


# Select the first 10 values from the description column in reviews, assigning the result to variable first_descriptions.
# Hint: format your output as a pandas Series.
first_descriptions = reviews.loc[0:9, 'description']


# Select the records with index labels 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, assigning the result to the variable sample_reviews.
# In other words, generate the following DataFrame:
sample_reviews = reviews.iloc[[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]]


# Create a variable df containing the country, province, region_1, and region_2 columns of the records with the index labels 0, 1, 10, and 100. 
df = reviews.loc[[0, 1, 10, 100],['country', 'province', 'region_1', 'region_2']]


# Create a variable df containing the country and variety columns of the first 100 records.
# Hint: you may use loc or iloc. When working on the answer this question and the several of the ones that follow, 
# keep the following "gotcha" described in the tutorial:
df = reviews.loc[:99,['country', 'variety']]


# Create a DataFrame italian_wines containing reviews of wines made in Italy. Hint: reviews.country equals what?
italian_wines = reviews.loc[reviews.country == 'Italy']


# Create a DataFrame top_oceania_wines containing all reviews with at least 95 points (out of 100) for wines from Australia or New Zealand.
top_oceania_wines = reviews.loc[((reviews.country == 'Australia') | (reviews.country == 'New Zealand')) & (reviews.points >= 95)]
